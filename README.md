# Monitoring Preservation of Refuge Survey Data Assets Tool

## Overview

**`check-survey-preservation`** is an R Shiny application for assessing and monitoring data management progress in the Refuge program. For a selected refuge, the tool generates an on-screen report that displays all current PRIMR surveys, their associated ServCat project/s, and the reference types, years, and counts for any preserved products.

While it was created with USFWS Region 7 (Alaska) in mind, it is designed for use by any and all regions.
